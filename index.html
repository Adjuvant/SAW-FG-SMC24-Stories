                        <p class="flow-text">Our stories centre around Gabrielle, a mid-20s programmer at a software
                            agency. At work, she organises work plans, creates code, and collaborates well with clients.
                            Gabrielle work is busy, many deadlines across different projects. In this churn of tasks,
                            office distractions are a challenge for her. But she strives to create a positive work
                            environment for everyone. The main thing she wants is for the team to work together better,
                            listen to each other's ideas, and support each other in finding solutions.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">The open-plan office is usually a bustling hub of activity and energy with
                            people coming and going throughout the day. The hum of conversation and work fill the air.
                            The scent of coffee wafts from the kitchen area. Desks sit in neat rows, and large windows
                            allow natural light to flood the space. Monitors glow with the bright colours of
                            screensavers and streams of emails.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">The hustle and bustle of a busy open-plan office isn't Gabrielle’s
                            favourite thing. She's surrounded by the sounds of clacking keyboards, distant
                            conversations, laughter, and sneezing. For her, loud conversations nearby and music can be
                            distracting when she's trying to concentrate. Although it can be overwhelming at times, she
                            has learned to tune out the noise and focus on her work.</p>

                        <p class="flow-text">This week HR decided to provide us all with a sound analyser device as part
                            of a wellbeing initiative. HR says that once they have collected data from everyone, they
                            can start looking at new policies for sound etiquette in the office. I was curious how this
                            would work out.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Today, I tested out the new sound tagging device. It was a handheld device
                            that allowed us to label sounds. By pointing it at a sound and pressing a button, I could
                            label it as either annoying or pleasant.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">I started off by tagging the sound of the coffee machine, which was a
                            comforting sound for me, one that reminded me of the start of a new day. The hum of the air
                            conditioner was also a pleasant sound, providing a constant background noise that seemed to
                            keep me focused. As I made my way around the office, I heard a printer jamming. It was an
                            irritating sound, so I quickly pointed the device at the printer and tagged it. But the
                            sound of my co-worker typing on their keyboard was rhythmic and soothing. As I walked around
                            further, I heard someone chewing and chomping. I tagged the sound as annoying and made a
                            mental note to avoid sitting near them during lunch.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Though it was uncomfortable at first, I started enjoying tagging things and
                            became more aware of the sounds around me. It helped me appreciate sounds in a new way and
                            feel more productive. I now feel more connected to my surroundings and appreciate the little
                            things that make everyday life special.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Once HR had all the data they wanted, we gave back the analyser devices,
                            which was a shame as I was still enjoying my little sound walks. A week later, tech support
                            installed monitoring microphones in the office, and we had a live visualisation of the
                            office sound map. It showed us all the good and bad parts of the office for different
                            activities. If you wanted to concentrate, the corner away from the meeting rooms was best.
                            If you wanted to brainstorm, the spaces by the lounge would cause the least disturbance to
                            others.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">At first, we were all self-conscious and tiptoed around the office, afraid
                            to disturb the sound map. But as we got used to it and experimented, we found that kindness
                            worked best. The system showed when we were polite, encouraging us to listen and respond
                            with empathy. We had more meaningful conversations, sharing stories without judgment or
                            interruption. As a result, the office became a place of connection and collaboration, where
                            everyone felt seen and heard. Together, we solved problems, brainstormed new ideas, and
                            created something beautiful.</p>

                    <div class="col s12 m8 l6">
                        <p class="flow-text">Given recent reports of noise disturbance in the office, HR decided that
                            something had to change, so they are trialling a new AI sound analyser service. They say
                            that once it’s trained, they can make new noise etiquette rules about what we can do where,
                            and when, in the office.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">So, HR assigned me a new task: testing a sound analyser device. It’s a box
                            with a bunch of microphones and buttons on it to label sounds as either annoying or
                            pleasant. After going through the obscure onboarding to position it in the room and
                            calibrate its microphones, it was ready to go. The how-to says that you should use it when
                            you notice a sound as either pleasant or annoying. But if you miss something the system is
                            monitoring for novel sounds and will request an office user for a label.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">So now the box tells when it wants me to label something in the web app.
                            Every so often I’m in the middle of coding and BING! the device lights up and I get a
                            notification on my screen. The analyser has decided I need to listen to something and give
                            it a label. I get it, it’s my task, but it is disrupting. Sometimes it takes ages to recover
                            from such changes of context.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Using it has surprised me in some ways. I've noticed how much I hate the
                            sound of my co-worker eating. Although there are sounds I enjoy, I tend to forget to use it
                            when I hear them. Instead, I only seem to reach for it when I'm annoyed by something. Also,
                            I can't help but feel like something has changed. I'm no longer listening to the sounds of
                            the office; I'm listening to something else. A judgement, a classification, a label.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Once HR had all the data they wanted, we gave back the analyser devices. A
                            week later, tech support installed monitoring microphones and LED fill lights throughout the
                            office. The service uses these to create a live visualisation of the office sound map,
                            showing all the areas with good and bad noise spots. Like a live colour map overlayed in the
                            office.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">The sound analyser service did more than check noise. It also provided
                            feedback on our tone and choice of words, acting like a judgmental co-worker critiquing
                            every utterance. This made me second-guess every sentence, speaking more cautiously to avoid
                            criticism from the analyser’s LED indicators. But even that was not enough, as it sometimes
                            criticised me for being too quiet or too loud. It felt like trying to please a shifting,
                            invisible audience.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">The sound analyser changed the office atmosphere and made us uncomfortable.
                            We felt judged, making us on edge. Office dynamics changed from a comfortable space to a
                            place of tension. I don't know if the Sound Analyzer service intended to do that, to change
                            the way we communicated with each other. But that's what it did. And now, I still feel its
                            presence, still feeling the judgmental microphone hovering over me, waiting for me to say
                            the wrong thing.</p>

                        <p class="flow-text">So, I heard about this new AI sound system from a colleague and decided to
                            give it a shot. The AI listens and changes the soundscape based on your preferences. Pretty
                            cool, huh?</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">It's a subscription service where you rent their special equipment. So, an
                            engineer came to install special speakers on my desk and set me up with the training
                            software. The software put me through a pile of sound examples and asked me to tag them as
                            pleasant or annoying to tune into my preferences. Once trained, I could choose from a range
                            of ‘moods’ via an app, including focus mode, relaxing, and social.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">At first, I was a bit sceptical. Could an AI change how I perceive the
                            world? Then something strange began to happen.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">The sound of waves lapping against the shore filled the reception area,
                            creating a sense of calm. The AI sent live sound from real places, like beaches and
                            rainforests, into public spaces. It was perfect for those who craved a little bit of nature
                            in their workday. A cool feature was it having different settings for times of the day.
                            During lunch breaks, the sounds of a bustling city street jostled. In the evening a gentle
                            river and birdsong calmed those working late. This made you feel like there were little
                            episodes to the day and you felt as is a story was unfolding.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">At my desk, the sounds of the office began to change. When someone began to
                            eat, and my annoyance rose, a low fuzzy drone slowly began to fill the air, just right to
                            block out the sound of the chewing. When someone tried to play music, the sound faded away
                            to an inaudible whisper. The AI sound system subtly adjusted to my environment, responding
                            to my mood, and created a sonic atmosphere that I was comfortable with. This made me feel a
                            sense of control and focus that I didn't have before.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">After fiddling with the profile system some more, it turns out I could make
                            new ‘moods’. So, I created a special soundscape for when I was brainstorming. It mixed the
                            sounds of a forest from my childhood, the chatter of a coffee shop, and the distant buzz of
                            a plane taking off. For some reason, this really worked when I was trying to come up with
                            ideas. During a group brainstorming session, something unusual happened. I arrived early to
                            the meeting room and logged into my profile to use the sound system and projector. But, once
                            we started working, a co-worker started complaining that they couldn't focus and began
                            questioning the strange soundscape. It’s cool, everyone is different, so we decided to turn
                            it off and continue our work without it.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Although the experience was initially disconcerting, I soon began to enjoy
                            it. When I move from my desk, the AI sound system fades away, and the familiar sounds of the
                            office surround me once again. But I'm happy in the knowledge that my little corner of the
                            office could be just the way I like it.</p>

                        <p class="flow-text">While I always found working in the office a little distracting, I had yet
                            to realise how bad it could get.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">While working at my computer, I heard an odd sound in the air. Confused, I
                            glanced around, but my colleagues were oblivious. I removed my headphones, but the sound
                            wasn't coming from them. The sound stopped, and I went back to work. But then another sound
                            disrupted me -- the sound of someone eating. It was coming from the other side of the
                            office, yet the noise seemed so close. At lunch in the staff room, it seemed like I could
                            hear rainforest birds chirping, so I stuck in my headphones. Then, as I walked through
                            reception to leave for the day, I heard waves crashing against the shore. It was nice, but I
                            also began to hear conversations in the background, as if they were coming from a real
                            place.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">As time went on, I noticed other strange things. Music would play that I
                            didn't like, and conversations would be louder than normal. It was as if something was
                            playing a cruel joke on me, trying to make me feel uncomfortable in my own workplace. I went
                            to HR to find out what was going on.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">The office got a new sound system that uses AI to change the sounds it
                            makes depending on what each person likes. There was also a nature sound system installed in
                            the public areas. HR sent a group email informing us, but I had missed it while on holiday.
                            This might explain why there were so many weird sounds around me.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">To dig a bit deeper, I signed up for the AI service and reviewed the FAQ. I
                            found that when the AI system lacks a user profile, it attempts to establish one through
                            trial and error. This is what it had been doing with me. To know my preferences, it
                            experimented on me. It noted my likes and dislikes through facial and behavioural
                            recognition. So, I reset my profile, suffered through two hours of tagging noises in their
                            web platform. Finally, I selected my preferences - nature sounds and no music for
                            concentration. For a while, it worked well. The office music softened to whisper, and eating
                            noises blurred into a low frequency mush. Monkeys and birds still battled in the staff room,
                            which, amusing at first, soon became distracting.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">But I started to notice other strange things about the sound system. Music
                            played that I didn't like, and colleague's Zoom chats boomed out. I tried to drown it out
                            with my nature sounds, but it kept making these weird errors.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">A customer support chatbot explained that the sound system blended my
                            preferences with those of my desk neighbour due to the special speaker placement.
                            Uncomfortable and distracted with this fuzzy blend, I removed my consent and data from the
                            platform. System tech support came in, altered the speaker arrangement. I took back
                            control.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Back in my normal chaos, I found relief. I stuck on my noise-cancelling
                            headphones and focused on my work. I learned that the simplest solution can often be the
                            best one.</p>

                        <p class="flow-text">Our stories centre on Darius, a mid-30s city planner and designer working
                            at an architecture consultancy. He lives in a small but comfy two-story house in the Bow
                            region of London with his partner and young daughter. Darius works from home but
                            occasionally attends studio meetings and site visits around the country. He spends his time
                            organising work plans, creating visualisations, and collaborating with clients.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Each morning, Darius wakes up early to enjoy a cup of coffee before
                            settling down at his desk. He looks out the window and takes in the sights and sounds of the
                            city. When his daughter is ready for playgroup, Darius walks her there. During his workday,
                            Darius takes walking breaks and occasionally works at a nearby café. He has a system and
                            schedule that works for him and his family and is committed to finding the right balance
                            between work and home life. Dedicating quality time with his daughter every day, Darius is
                            confident he can maintain a comfortable and productive home office environment.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Darius has set up a home office that enables him to focus and be
                            productive. His office area is in the spare bedroom next to the living room, it is also a
                            place for guests to stay and additional storage. The office is equipped with all the
                            necessary tools and equipment, including a computer, drawing tablet, assorted office
                            equipment, and document systems. The normal distractions are his daughter playing in the
                            living room and the neighbour's dog barking. However, recently construction work has started
                            on the neighbour's basement conversion, resulting in significant noise issues due to
                            drilling, workmen, and other machine noise.</p>

                            This week HR decided to provide us all with a sound analyser device as part of a wellbeing
                            initiative. HR says that once they have collected data from everyone, they can start looking
                            at new policies for sound etiquette for remote workers. I was curious how this would work
                            out.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            Today, I tested out the new sound tagging device at home. It was a handheld device that
                            allowed us to label sounds. By pointing it at a sound and pressing a button, I could label
                            it as either annoying or pleasant.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            I started off by tagging the sound of birds chirping outside, which was a comforting sound
                            for me, one that reminded me of the start of a new day. The sound of the rain was also a
                            pleasant sound, providing a constant background noise that seemed to keep me focused. As I
                            made my way around my home, I heard the dishwasher. Such an irritating sound, so I quickly
                            pointed the device at it and tagged it. As I walked around further, I heard the regular
                            mid-week morning sound of my neighbour mowing their lawn. I tagged the sound as annoying and
                            made a mental note to avoid scheduling calls during that time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            Though it was uncomfortable at first, I started enjoying tagging things and became more
                            aware of the sounds around me. It helped me appreciate sounds in a new way and feel more
                            productive. I now feel more connected to my surroundings and appreciate the little things
                            that make everyday life special.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            Once HR had all the data they wanted, I gave back the analyser device, which was a shame as
                            I was still enjoying my little sound walks. A week later, tech support installed monitoring
                            microphones in my home, and it connected to a live sound map visualisation. It showed me all
                            the good parts and times in my home for different activities. If you wanted to concentrate,
                            the corner away from the street noise in the afternoon was best. If you wanted to take a
                            break, the spaces by the kitchen would have the best relaxation sounds.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            At first, I was self-conscious and tiptoed around my home, afraid to disturb the sound map.
                            But as I got used to it and experimented, I found that it analysed my communication too. The
                            system showed when I was polite, encouraging me to listen and respond with empathy. I had
                            more meaningful conversations, sharing stories without judgment or interruption. As a
                            result, my home became a place of connection and productivity. I solved problems,
                            brainstormed new ideas, and created something beautiful with my remote co-workers.
                        </p>

                            Given recent reports of noise disturbance for home office workers, HR decided that something
                            had to change, so they are trialling a new AI sound analyser service. They say that once
                            it’s trained, they can make new noise etiquette rules about what we can do where, and when,
                            while working from home.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            So, HR assigned me a new task: testing a sound analyser device. It’s a box with a bunch of
                            microphones and buttons on it to label sounds as either annoying or pleasant. After going
                            through the obscure onboarding to position it in the room and calibrate its microphones, it
                            was ready to go. The how-to says that you should use it when you notice a sound as either
                            pleasant or annoying. But if you miss something the system is monitoring for novel sounds
                            and will request a me for a label.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            So now the box tells when it wants me to label something in the web app. Every so often I’m
                            in the middle of something and BING! the device lights up and I get a notification on my
                            screen. The analyser has decided I need to listen to something and give it a label. I get
                            it, it’s my task, but it is disrupting. Sometimes it takes ages to recover from such changes
                            of context.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            Using it has surprised me in some ways. I've noticed how much I hate the sound of kids TV
                            songs. Although there are sounds I enjoy, I tend to forget to use it when I hear them.
                            Instead, I only seem to reach for it when I'm annoyed by something. Also, I can't help but
                            feel like something has changed. I'm no longer listening to the sounds of my home office;
                            I'm listening to something else. A judgement, a classification, a label.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            Once HR had all the data they wanted, I returned the analyser device. A week later, tech
                            support installed monitoring microphones and LED fill lights throughout my home office. The
                            service uses these to create a live visualisation of the sound map, showing all the areas
                            with good and bad noise spots. Like a live colour map overlayed in my home office.

                            The sound analyser service did more than check noise. It also provided feedback on my tone
                            and choice of words, acting like a judgmental colleague critiquing every utterance. This
                            made me second-guess every sentence, speaking more cautiously to avoid criticism from the
                            analyser’s LED indicators. But even that was not enough, as it sometimes criticised me for
                            being too quiet or too loud. It felt like trying to please a shifting, invisible audience.

                        <p class="flow-text">
                            The sound analyser changed the home office atmosphere and made me uncomfortable. I felt
                            judged, making me on edge. Dynamics changed from a comfortable space to a place of tension.
                            I don't know if the Sound Analyser service intended to do that, to change the way I
                            communicated. But that's what it did. And now, I still feel its presence, that judgmental
                            microphone hovering over me, waiting for me to say the wrong thing.

                            So, I heard about this new AI sound system from a colleague and decided to give it a shot
                            while working from home. The AI listens and changes the soundscape based on your
                            preferences. Pretty cool, huh?
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            It's a subscription service where you rent their special equipment. So, tech support came to
                            install special speakers in my home office and set me up with the training software. The
                            software put me through a pile of sound examples and asked me to tag them as pleasant or
                            annoying to tune into my preferences. Once trained, I could choose from a range of ‘moods’
                            via an app, including focus mode, relaxing, and social.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            At first, I was a bit sceptical. Could an AI change how I perceive the world? Then something
                            strange began to happen.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            The sound of waves lapping against the shore filled my home office, creating a sense of
                            calm. The AI sent live sound from real places, like beaches and rainforests, into my
                            workspace. It was perfect when I craved a little bit of nature but the weather outside was
                            bad. A cool feature was it having different settings for times of the day. During lunch
                            breaks, the sounds of a bustling city street jostled. In the evening a gentle river and
                            birdsong calmed me when working late. This made you feel like there were little episodes to
                            the day and you felt as if a story was unfolding.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            At my desk, the sounds of my home began to change. When my daughter began to watch TV, and
                            my annoyance rose, a low fuzzy drone slowly began to fill the air, just right to block out
                            the sound of the inane kids’ songs. When my neighbours played music in the garden, the sound
                            faded away to an inaudible whisper. The AI sound system subtly adjusted to my environment,
                            responding to my mood, and creating a sonic atmosphere that I was comfortable with. This
                            made me feel a sense of control and focus that I didn't have before.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            After fiddling with the profile system some more, it turns out I could make new ‘moods’. So,
                            I created a special soundscape for when I was brainstorming. It mixed the sounds of a forest
                            from my childhood, the chatter of a coffee shop, and the distant buzz of a plane taking off.
                            For some reason, this really worked when I was trying to come up with ideas. During a remote
                            group brainstorming session, something unusual happened. I decided to stream my new sound
                            mood via the conferencing system. But, once we started working, a co-worker started
                            complaining that they couldn't focus and began questioning the strange soundscape. It’s
                            cool, everyone is different, so we decided to turn it off and continue our work without it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            Although the experience was initially disconcerting, I soon began to enjoy it. When I move
                            from my desk, the AI sound system fades away, and the familiar sounds of my home surround me
                            once again. But I'm happy in the knowledge that my little corner of the home office could be
                            just the way I like it.

                            While I always found working from home to be distracting at times, I had yet to realise how
                            bad it could be.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            While working at my computer, I heard an odd sound in the air. Confused, I glanced around,
                            but my family members out. I checked if the radio was still on in the kitchen, but the sound
                            wasn't coming from that. The sound stopped, and I went back to work. But then another sound
                            disrupted me -- the sound of someone eating. It was coming from the kitchen, yet the noise
                            seemed so close. During lunch, it seemed like I could hear birds chirping outside, so I
                            stuck in my headphones. Then, as I came to the end my workday, I heard birdsong and rustling
                            leaves. It was nice, but I also began to hear conversations in the background, as if the
                            sounds were coming from a real place.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            As time went on, I noticed other strange things. Music would play from the living room that
                            I didn't like, and conversations would be louder than normal. It was as if something was
                            playing a cruel joke on me, trying to make me feel uncomfortable in my own home. I tried to
                            focus on my work, but it was becoming increasingly difficult with all these distractions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            Then I remembered, not long ago, HR sent round tech installers to fit a new sound system,
                            but I ignored the other info in the email as I was preparing for a big presentation that
                            day. The system was a bunch of networked smart speakers and cameras throughout my home. I
                            thought it was just a neat perk, but it turns that it uses AI to change the soundscape
                            depending on what I like. This might explain why there were so many weird sounds around me!
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            To dig a bit deeper, I signed up for the AI service and reviewed the FAQ. I found that when
                            the system lacks a user profile, it attempts to establish one through trial and error. This
                            is what it had been doing with me. To know my preferences, it experimented on me. It noted
                            my likes and dislikes through facial and behavioural recognition. So, I reset my profile,
                            suffered through two hours of tagging noises in their web platform. Finally, I selected my
                            preferences - nature sounds and no music for concentration. For a while, it worked well. The
                            TV music blurred into a low frequency mush, and it blocked out the outside construction
                            noises. But I started to notice other strange things about the system. Music played that I
                            didn't like, and my family's kitchen chats boomed out in my office. I tried to drown it out
                            with my nature sounds, but it kept making these weird errors.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            A customer support chatbot explained that the system blended my preferences with those of my
                            family members due to the way the AI system was seeking to balance the sound profiles.
                            Uncomfortable and distracted with this fuzzy blend, I decided to take back control. I
                            requested HR remove the system from my house, and I reached for my noise-cancelling
                            headphones when things got rowdy. It was a simple solution, but it worked. I learned that
                            sometimes, the simplest solution can often be the best one.
